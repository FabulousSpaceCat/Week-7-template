# Spooky Cookie Witch

The goal here is to obtain a name and email address.  There's a fun little Spooktober theme going on with it.

It should validate your input both as you go and on the backend.  Names and email addresses should be unique.  Form errors will be directed to an error page. HTTP errors are handled but not in the page theme.

There is an sql file to help you set up the database the same way that I did, and also some information prepopulated into it if you'd like to start off with a few pennies in your bowl.

Requirements:
- nodejs
